apogeeguess1 = xyz.
apogeeguess2 = xyz2.
from origin. 
record time and pressure. 
turn pressure into altitude. - start alldata array 

for each new datapoint collected. 
1. put into alldata array. 
2. check if altitude > 10
	if yes - define time here as initlaunchtime. 
	create an array from initlaunchtime till present time - called Launchdata. 
	
		3. (CHECKING IF MAX THRUST ALTITUDE HAS BEEN REACHED)
		if altitude >220. 
			record time here is MTAT (max thrust altitude time)
				
				while apogeeguess2 - apogeeguess1 > VALUE. 
				apogeeguess2 = apogeeguess1
				4. start a for loop from MTAT to end.
				put all data from here into new array called Analysetime and Analysepressure.
				Put in the matrix to calculate the quadratic coefficients, alpha, beta, gamma. 
			

				MATHS PART:
				1. Calculate the differentiation. 
				2. Let it equal to 0 + calculate a value of t. 
				3. Put t back into the main equation to find an altitude guess. 	
				4. apogeeguess2 = altitudeguess.
				

		5. Display final apogee value. 
		if current altitude - apogeeguess2 < value2. 
		stop recording data into launch data and say tha apogee has been reached.
