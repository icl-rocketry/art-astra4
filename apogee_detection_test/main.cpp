//possible corrections
//Incorrect Data: It's possible that the data being read from the file does not represent the actual altitude or pressure values correctly. If the data is incorrect or improperly formatted, it could lead to incorrect detection of apogee.
//Incorrect Implementation: The logic within the ApogeeDetector class might not be properly implemented to detect apogee based on altitude and pressure values. There could be a bug or error in the implementation that causes incorrect detection.
//Incorrect Configuration: The parameters used to configure the ApogeeDetector instance, such as the initial time (times.at(0)) or the threshold value (20), might not be set correctly for the given data. Adjusting these parameters according to the specific context and data characteristics could be necessary to achieve accurate apogeeÂ detection.
